## America is now going through an AI technological revolution and Tesla has been at the forefront of that revolution. Tesa plans on building an AI supercomputer code named Dojo that will help to train entirely
self-driving neural networks. Dojo is intended to help enable Tesaâ€™s future self-driving vehicles and recently announced self-driving taxi to safely drive the highways and side roads without human intervention. 
Tesla has been collecting millions of miles of video footage taken from its vehicles with the intention of using that data to train Dojo to use only camera footage and its artificial intelligence to make decisions.
